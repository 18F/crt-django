          <h2>Questions?</h2>
          <p>If you have a question about whether you should route a report to a particular section, start by talking to
            your supervisor</p>
          <p>If you still have questions, call or message the current point of contact for a given section.</p>

              Final Note - This guide is designed to be practical, not precise.
            </strong>
            The federal civil rights laws we enforce are varied and complex. When we list a section for routing, it does
            not mean that the section will
            necessarily have enforcement authority for that report. It also does not mean this section is the only one
            who
            might have enforcement authority. Being listed here only means this section is likely best positioned to
            know the right next step for this kind of report.
